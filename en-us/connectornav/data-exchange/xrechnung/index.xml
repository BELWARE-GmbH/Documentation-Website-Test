        <description>Possible document types Currently it is possible to convert the following document types into an XRechnung:
  Sales invoices
  Sales credit memos
  Service invoices
  Service credit memos
  The following sections demonstrate an example of XRechnung generation for sales invoices. The procedures shown here for sales invoices are almost identical to those for the other possible document types. That is, you can perform the methods shown here analogously for the other types, such as service credit memos.</description>

        <guid>https://docs.belware.de/en-us/connectornav/data-exchange/xrechnung/setup/</guid>
        <description>Setup The setup for XRechnung is done in the Connector-Setup and in the Communication Matrix. To get into Setup, go to Connector 365 -&amp;gt; Setup as shown in the following image.
You may want to review some master data prior to deployment so that you don&amp;rsquo;t run into errors in later shipping that can be avoided. See the end of the documentation for more information. The settings that affect XRechnung can be found in the Per Client section under the PEPPOL/XRechnung Setup tab.</description>

        <title>Routing ID</title>

        <description>Routing ID As mentioned earlier, the routing ID is used to uniquely identify invoice recipients to enable addressing and, if necessary, routing of electronic invoices to the correct administrative units. Basically, a routing ID consists of the following components:
  Coarse addressing
  Fine addressing (optional)
  Check digit
  Further information on the structure of a routing ID can be found here.
The Connector is able to check the syntax of a route ID for correctness.</description>

        <description>Create XRechnung Now that we have created the XRechnung entry for Gilde Jupiter Versicherungs AG for the PDF job mode, we can create an XRechnung from the selected 103003 invoice using the PDF button.
Alternatively, this can also be done using the Batch Run button, provided that the relevant entry in the communication matrix has been marked for batch mode:
As soon as one of the above buttons has been activated, an XRechnung will be generated from the selected invoice.</description>

        <description>Accompanying documents The XRechnung standard allows attachments to accompany invoices.
This standard allows attachments of the following MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) types:
  Application/pdf (.pdf)
  Image/png (.png)
  Image/jpeg (.jpg)
  Text/CSV (.csv)
  Application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheethtml.sheet (.xslx)
  Excel tables
  Application/vnd.oasis.opendocument.spreadsheet (.ods)
  OpenDocument tables
  PDF attachments may be considered insecure by some clients and are accordingly marked as such by XRechnung Portal Deutschland.</description>

        <description>Send XRechnung directly by e-mail (Connector e-mail module) If you have also installed the Connector365 module Email, you can send an XRechnung directly by e-mail through the Connector after it has been generated. For this you have to make an adjustment in the communication matrix.
Simply change the value of the Job Mode field from PDF to Email. In addition, you can optionally enter a default destination address. Now the marked invoice can be converted to XRechnung format via the Email button, or via the Batch button, if the batch mode entry has been marked, and sent on directly via e-mail.</description>

        <description>Analyze validation results in case of error During the validation of the XRechnung file, it can of course also happen that an XRechnung is classified as non-compliant. This happens when important information is missing from the invoice. For example, validation will fail even if the customer&amp;rsquo;s city is not specified.
To simulate a case where validation fails, we modify the above procedure to &amp;ldquo;forget&amp;rdquo; to specify a routing ID. To do this, we again open the Communication Matrix for our example calculation 103003, and remove the value for the route ID.</description>

        <description>Further information on troubleshooting In this documentation, a possible case of an incorrect validation was shown as an example. In addition to the problem shown there with the routing ID, there are several other sources of errors. Therefore, it is enormously advantageous to use a validation service, as otherwise errors may only be noticed in one of the invoice portals or by the invoice recipient. Using the validation report and with the help of the PEPPOL BIS Billing 3.</description>
