What these folders are used for is explained below.\nThe installation of the eDocPrintPro The Connector NAV generates vouchers as PDF documents. For Microsoft Dynamics NAV versions \u0026gt; 2009 R2 Classic the internal SAVEASPDF can be used and no further measures have to be taken. For all other versions we recommend the free PDF printer driver from X.KEY GmbH.\nPicture: Printer setup eDocPrintPro, about tab\nConnector NAV is tested with eDocPrintPro version 3.21.2.0. eDocPrintPro is a free product for generating PDF files and can be used as an alternative to the SAVEASPDF function of NAV 2013 R2. Installation instructions and more can be found at http://wiki.xkey.at/doku.php?id=edocprintpro_pdf_und_pdf_a\nTo install the eDocPrintPro, execute the following steps (excerpt from the XKEY WIKI):\nAll versions before 3.18.0: Before each new installation (also UPDATES) all existing versions must be uninstalled!\nVersions from 3.18.0: Due to the use of new setup software, with the current version it is no longer necessary for already installed versions from 3.18.0 to manually uninstall the software before installing the new version. An already installed version (from 3.18.0) is detected and automatically removed before the new installation. The installation adds a virtual printer to the system which can create PDF and other formats like TIFF, JPG and others.\nRecommendation to avoid support cases in advance:\n Please remove all other PDF printers that are not necessary for you. Also \u0026ldquo;old\u0026rdquo; versions of the eDocPrintPro! Check if you have ONLY the current version of GhostScript installed and remove \u0026ldquo;old\u0026rdquo; versions that are not needed.   download the installation ZIP package from www.pdfprinter.at double click on the .ZIP file in the download folder execute the setup.exe follow the instructions on the screen  A common setup for the 32bit and 64bit version instead of single setups The setups and EXE files are signed - Verisign Class 3 - Code Sign certificate!\neDocPrintPro appears then as printer in your printer list and there you can start the configuration (print settings).\nAdditional notes OfficeMaster for E-Mail and Fax When licensing the interface OfficeMaster, the following settings must be configured in the file gateway. Here, the folder names refer to the folders in the Setup and Configuration documentation. The settings can be found under: Messaging Server Configuration -\u0026gt; Component Status -\u0026gt; File Gateway -\u0026gt; Show Configuration.\nOfficeMaster Filegateway, Settings General\nImportant new feature for file handling With the Connector NAV update to version 7.01.125 the file handling has been made more comfortable. Pre-populating attachments (e.g. in the user report setup) now also allows the user to select local files. The selected file is automatically uploaded to the server under the path com_tmp. The same applies to changing attachments or body texts in the dialog.\nDisplaying attachments (e.g. from the job list) no longer requires direct access to the network share. The file is downloaded locally from the server to the user\u0026rsquo;s workstation and opened. To avoid the accumulation of temporarily stored files, a message is displayed afterwards asking whether the tmp folder should be deleted. This folder is automatically created during the download under %temp% of the user and is not visible to the user under normal circumstances.

These placeholders are replaced by the values of the environment varibles.   Path (com_job) The job files are stored in this path. The Connector NAV names and composes the name of the file from the prefix, the sequence number, the job list and the job identifier. Example: CON5236.JOB   Path (com_out) This path specification serves as destination for the file generated by the printer (e.g. PDF). This is created according to the above scheme. These files are to be deleted or archived from time to time.   Path (com_in) This is the path specification for incoming faxes.

The Connector NAV Files Overview With the Connector NAV it is now possible to attach external documents to an e-mail in addition to the four attachments. For more details, see the separate documentation for the Email module.\nConnector NAV files overview\nOn request, the Connector NAV files can also be added automatically.\nExample scenario: A customer has additional PDF documents for certain items. When sending an offer, Connector NAV searches for the corresponding document for the offer lines via an external function and adds these to the e-mail as an attachment.\nThe Connector NAV Feedback Overview The Connector NAV Feedback Overview\nThe Connector NAV feedback overview displays the feedback received for each of the job orders issued in tabular form, together with the status information.\n   Field description of the most important fields      Job Reference Indicates to which job entry the feedback belongs.   Feedback date/time Navision Job Number.   FUNKTION SENDACK = Feedback file.   USERINFO User.   SERVICE FX3 = Fax Job / SMTP = E-Mail Job.   SENDTIME IMMEDIATE = Immediate shipping or default shipping time jj-mm-tt-hh:mm.   STATUS + successful operation / - error during operation.   ERROR Status message as text.   SUBADDR The extension number is displayed for incoming faxes.   Read Currently this field has no function and is a remnant of an old requirement.   Filelist Path and document name. (Document)   Filelist 2 Path and document name. (Bodytext)   Filelist 3 Path and document name. (Attachment)   Filelist 4 Path and document name. (Attachment 2)   Filelist 5 Path and document name. (Attachment 3)   Filelist 6 Path and document name. (Attachemnt 4)   Document Document from filelist as BLOB in the database.   Document 2 Document from filelist 2 as BLOB in the database.   Document 3 Document from filelist 3 as BLOB in the database.   Document 4 Document from filelist 4 as BLOB in the database.   Document 5 Document from filelist 5 as BLOB in the database.   Document 6 Document from filelist 6 as BLOB in the database.    Numerous other fields are displayed or are available in the background. All fields from the confirmation files are read in and are thus available for further processing in Microsoft Dynamics NAV.\nThe most essential information is however the Statusinformation, i.e. whether the order could also be successfully executed. The confirmation card offers the possibility the documents from the data base and/or due to the FILELIST data to indicate. It is also possible to import/delete the documents afterwards. A further useful feature is the reactivation from the feedback map.\nAdvantage of the data base storage is that the data can be indicated always, an access to the path mentioned is not necessary in contrast to the variant without data base storage. In both cases there is quasi an archive of the documents from the job list.\nThe Connector NAV feedback card Register General Connector NAV feedback card, Register General\nRegister files Connector NAV feedback card, Register files\nRegister feedback Connector NAV feedback card, Register feedback\nThe confirmation card provides a detailed overview of each confirmation of an operation. For e-mail and fax interfaces with a confirmation (OfficeMaster, Twinfax, Faxmaker), the Confirmation tab reads and displays this file.\nActions in the feedback card Show filelists Connector NAV feedback card, actions\nUsing the filelist functions, you can display the job file (FILELIST), body text file (FILELIST 2) or attachments 1-4 (FILELIST 3-6) for each response.\nDocument Connector NAV feedback card, actions\nUsing the document functions you can import, export or delete the above mentioned files.\nThe Connector NAV feedback instant overview Connector NAV feedback card\nThis manual request makes it possible to confirm the previous feedbacks. The field Read can be set to \u0026ldquo;Yes\u0026rdquo; by setting a check mark (= click), only records with the value Read = No will be displayed.\nThis form can also be requested automatically at appropriate points to force a confirmation, this workflow is used to make it mandatory to verify correct dispatch.\nThe Connector NAV Statistics Connector NAV Statistics\n   field describtion      CTI entries, on-off Visual view of CTI operations.

We recommend regularly following the blog at http://www.pdfblog.at/category/ipaper/.\nThe configuration In order for the Connector NAV and iPaper FM to communicate properly with each other, certain settings must match in the Connector NAV pdfPaper setup as well as in the iPaper FM configuration.\nThe Connector NAV pdfPaper setup Actions Connector 365 BC pdfPaper setup, actions\n   Actions      Show stationery This action allows you to display the stored stationery.    Register pdfPaper Server Connector 365 BC pdfPaper setup, register pdfPaper Server\nInput folder:\nThe Connector 365 BC creates an external XML control file for iPaper FM during an operation. This is expected by iPaper FM in the input folder.\nOutput folder:\nSuccessfully processed PDF documents are copied by iPaper FM to an output folder. This should be the \u0026ldquo;com_out\u0026rdquo; folder from the Connector NAV setup.\nError folder:\nIf PDF documents were not processed by iPaper FM, an XML file with error information is placed in the error folder.\nPreview folder:\nThis folder is used to create temporary PDF documents for the pdfPaper Preview action.\nPDF Level\nHere you can specify the level of PDF/A encryption, the choices are PDF/A-1b, PDF/A-3b and no encryption.\nPrint Server\nWith this switch you determine whether a print server is in use.\nPrint server input order\nIf a print server is used by you, you can specify here where documents to be printed should be stored.\nPDFA ZUGFeRD path\nDefines the path where XML files created according to the ZUGFeRD standard are stored or archived.\nProcessing time (in sec.):\nHere you enter the time that the Connector NAV should wait until the PDF document appears in the output folder. If the document is not found after this time, the process has failed. The time depends on how big / how many pages / how complex the reports are. As an average value we recommend 30 seconds.\nWriting paper:\nSelect here the general stationery to be included with each operation. Also create a folder here in your shared network (here PRESETS) where you store all business stationery or other PDF files for mixing.\nWriting paper for the process printout:\nSelect here the generally valid stationery, which is to be mixed to each printing process.\nPrinter for the Printout process:\nEnter here the printer that is to print the document during the printing process.\nAutomatic rotation\nIn case documents are extended by e.g. attachments with pages in landscape format, you can define here that they are rotated to portrait format during processing.\nActivating the iPaper licence After installing the iPaper, it initially runs under a 30-day trial version, which allows full use of the iPaper until it expires. After the 30 days have expired, the iPaper can still be used, but from that point onwards a stamp is placed on the PDF documents created. This is usually not a problem on test systems, but iPaper should be fully activated at the latest when it is transferred to the live system.\nTo activate your licence you need the Product Activation Manager (PAM). You can either open this directly via the Windows search function or right-click on the iPaper icon in your toolbar and then click on Info and then Activate.\nIn the PAM you will now see a listing of the installed iPaper version and a related demo license. To fully activate the license, click on \u0026ldquo;Activate application\u0026rdquo;. A new dialog opens where you can enter your license data under \u0026ldquo;Activate online\u0026rdquo;. You have received these from us during delivery.\nAfter confirming the dialog another window opens, here you can see all licenses that belong to your account, select a suitable license and confirm the dialog. You should now find another license in the list next to your demo license. An optional step is to select the demo license and remove it with \u0026ldquo;Remove license\u0026rdquo;.\nIf you need support in this process please contact us, we will be happy to help you.\nMove licenses iPaper licenses are always bound to one computer, but since it happens that computers are exchanged, you have here the license to \u0026ldquo;move\u0026rdquo;.\nOpen the PAM again and select the license you want to move to another computer and click on \u0026ldquo;Move license\u0026rdquo;, this moves the license back into the pool of your other licenses and can thus be activated again as a normal license.\nThe iPaper.NET server configuration In the desktop bar, if iPaper FM is started, you will find a feather with which you can access the configurations via \u0026ldquo;right-mouse-click\u0026rdquo;.\niPaper.NET server, open configuration\nThen you will see an overview of the folders that have been set up. Before setting up a folder, you need to define the template folder (Stationery Tray). To execute it, please execute the action shown at the bottom right of the image (General settings).\niPaper.NET server, configuration\nShared folder tab iPaper.NET Server Configuration, Shared Folder tab\nSelect the stationery folder you created for the Connector NAV pdfPaper setup. When shuffling documents, the iPaper.NET server will access this folder. All stationery templates must be stored here.\nThen a new folder is created via the action Add folder.\nRegister general iPaper.NET server, register general\nTransfer the pdfPaper setup from the previous chapter into the corresponding fields.\nRegister options iPaper.NET server, register options\nTransfer the settings on the image. The files to be processed are XML files. These are automatically generated by Connector NAV. The document must then be moved to the archive folder, where you will be used for further processing by e-mail/fax.\nPreview folder After the main setup is done, create a new folder. The following settings must be made for the preview folder:\niPaper.NET server, register general\nThen enter the same settings under the Options tab as in the picture above.\nClose the configuration and start the iPaper.NET server.\n","description":"","id":66,"section":"connectornav","tags":null,"title":"The pdfPaper Server module","uri":"https://docs.belware.de/en-us/connectornav/pdfpaper/pdfpaper_server/"},{"content":"This part of our docs page is under construction This part of the website is still being worked on and as such is not yet available to the public.\nPlease return at a later date, when we will have added further informative content about the usage of our solutions to this website.\n","description":"","id":67,"section":"","tags":null,"title":"Under Construction","uri":"https://docs.belware.de/en-us/under-construction/"},{"content":"New and planned Version 1.0.0.0  Automatic attachment of reminded invoices to reminder on sending of reminder Control of sending by reminder level Control of sending by reminder method  Planned functions for future versions  Automatic attachment of delivery bills  ","description":"","id":68,"section":"Apps","tags":null,"title":"V1.0.0.0 \u0026 Roadmap","uri":"https://docs.belware.de/en-us/apps/easydocumentpin/new-and-planned/v1.0.0.0/"},{"content":"New and planned Version 1.0.0.0  Intelligent control of sender address per report via Mail Sender Plus Intelligent control of attachments at different levels via Mail Attachments Plus Intelligent control of subject line with placeholders via Mail Subject Plus  ","description":"","id":69,"section":"Apps","tags":null,"title":"V1.0.0.0 \u0026 Roadmap","uri":"https://docs.belware.de/en-us/apps/mailexperienceplus/new-and-planned/v1.0.0.0/"},{"content":"New and planned Version 1.0.0.10  Error correction during transfer of attachments  Planned features for future versions  Attachment functionalities on further levels  ","description":"","id":70,"section":"Apps","tags":null,"title":"V1.0.0.10 \u0026 Roadmap","uri":"https://docs.belware.de/en-us/apps/mail_attachment_plus/new-and-planned/v1.0.0.10/"},{"content":"New and planned Version 1.0.0.2  Advanced mail setup with multiple senders Changeable sender address in dialog Set an address per user A default address per report A default address per vendor/customer  Planned functions for future versions  Customize to the Mail Experience  ","description":"","id":71,"section":"Apps","tags":null,"title":"V1.0.0.2 \u0026 Roadmap","uri":"https://docs.belware.de/en-us/apps/mail-sender-plus/new-and-planned/v1.0.0.2/"},{"content":"New and planned Version 1.0.0.8  Fix: Negative status if E-Mail Codeunit fails Fix: Write E-Mail related information to joblist  Planned functions for future versions  Integration of credit-side documents.

We recommend using placeholders here which could not accidentally appear in the subject, for example, if you define the placeholder Inv for the invoice number and the subject contains the word Invoice, the Inv part of the word would be replaced in the subject. It is best to use a combination of special characters and numbers or adjust placeholders so that they do not accidentally appear in words.\nNow you have to define the field to which the placeholder refers. Here you have all the respective fields from the report you are currently in at your disposal.\nRepeat this process for all fields/placeholders you want to use in your subject.\nExample of a subject with placeholders Now that you have defined your placeholders, you can define the subject with placeholders. Close the placeholder setup and click again in the \u0026ldquo;Email Subject\u0026rdquo; field. For our example, we have defined the following placeholders for an invoice.\n %1 - the invoice number %2 - The recipient name %3 - The due date  With this we could now for example, build this subject: Our invoice %1 for %2 - Due %3\nhow the subject then looks in use, you will find out in the next step.\n","description":"","id":98,"section":"Apps","tags":null,"title":"Document layouts","uri":"https://docs.belware.de/en-us/apps/mailsubject/first-steps/setup/documentlayouts/"},{"content":"Setup Document Sending Profile The document send profile is a standard functionality of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central.\nIt is used to control the preferred method of sending sales documents.

To get into Setup, go to Connector 365 -\u0026gt; Setup as shown in the following image.\nYou may want to review some master data prior to deployment so that you don\u0026rsquo;t run into errors in later shipping that can be avoided. See the end of the documentation for more information.\r The settings that affect XRechnung can be found in the Per Client section under the PEPPOL/XRechnung Setup tab.\nHere you can find the following fields/checkboxes:\n         PEPPOL storage path (optional) Here you can define a path where PEPPOL/XRechnung related files (XML files, test reports) should be stored. If this path is not set, the path com_out stored in the setup will be used for storage.   XRechnung validation URL (Optional) URL for validation server. If not set up by default: belware-validator.westeurope.cloudapp.azure.com:5090   Validate XRechnung [Yes/No] Specifies whether XRechnung files should be validated by XRechnung Validation URL.    As already mentioned in the preparation, you have the possibility to use our validation server. It checks if the generated XRechnung is compliant with the formal requirements. If you want to use your own server, you can enter your server URL in the XRechnung validation URL field. As soon as this field is filled, the validation process will be triggered by the entered server. In order for the validation to take place, an additional checkmark must be placed in the XRechnung check checkbox below. If you want to do without validation, you can leave the checkbox empty. (Not recommended)\nThe further setup for XRechnung takes place in the communication matrix.\nThe easiest way to get into the communication matrix is to open one of the Connector 365 Templates for Sales, e.g. Sales Invoices or Sales Credit Notes.\nThen highlight an invoice for a customer for whom you want to send invoices in XRechnung format and click Communication Matrix. at the top of the bar.\nThis will open the communication matrix, pre-filtered to the customer stored in the highlighted invoice.\nThis only works if an entry has already been created in the communication matrix for the relevant customer. If no relevant entry has been created, the following variant must be used.\r Alternatively, you can open the communication matrix via the Connector 365 menu.\nHowever, you will then find an unfiltered view that gives you an overview of all entries in the matrix.\nFor more information on the Communication Matrix, please refer to the associated documentation.\nThe XRechnung module extends the Communication Matrix with the following columns:\nXRechnung, Route ID and XRechnung PDF as attachment.\nIn the following example we want to create an invoice for Gilde Jupiter Versicherungs AG in XRechnung format. To do this, we enter the number 1306 (Standard Sales - Invoice) in the Report ID field. For the Job Mode we select PDF. In addition, we place a check mark in the XRechnung field and enter a valid routing ID in the Routing ID field. In this test example, we entered a test routing ID 123-456-76.\nThe route ID is used to uniquely identify the invoice recipient (see the section: route ID for more details).\nUsing the Dropdown list XRechnung PDF as attachment you have the option to determine whether the invoice should be \u0026lsquo;attached\u0026rsquo; as a PDF file in addition to the XRechnung. The PDF file can either be handled by mail as an additional attachment (Mail module), or embedded in the XML file. For more information on embedded attachments, see the Accompanying Documents section.\nSince the invoice is a sales invoice, we select Sales Invoice from the Dropdown List in the PEPPOL Usage field.\nFrom the Dropdown list of the PEPPOL Version field we select PEPPOL BIS3. Now we can create an XRechnung from the invoice.\nIf you have purchased the e-mail module of Connector 365, you can also set up XRechnung for e-mail job mode to forward generated XML files directly to the recipient by mail.\r ","description":"","id":173,"section":"connectornav","tags":null,"title":"Setup","uri":"https://docs.belware.de/en-us/connectornav/data-exchange/xrechnung/setup/"},{"content":"Setup Connector NAV for the segments dispatch Now that the list of contacts that will receive the segment has been prepared, it\u0026rsquo;s time to set up the mail with Connector NAV.

The business terms are passed as text variables. Prepended to these variables is the keyword VAR, which indicates that the variables are references to the original variables.\nAfter you have defined a function as a subscriber, you can fill the passed variables as you like and according to your own logic.\nExample*\nThe function SubAfterGetLineInvoicePeriod is here a subscriber for the event OnAfterGetLineInvoicePeriodInfo.\nRegardless of the default logic of filling the variables, InvLineInvoicePeriodEndDate after generating the XRechnung now contains the value \u0026ldquo;2021-04-15\u0026rdquo; and thus appears in the resulting XML file. The same procedure applies to all other events.\nThe following is a list of the available events and the variables to be changed with them.\nAt the beginning of the XML port, it is checked whether the document is a sales document or a service document.

To avoid this, it is recommended to use PDF/A files instead. These have a higher security level and are therefore also classified as secure attachments by the portal. The following is a quote from the Central Invoice Receiving Office of the Federal Government (ZRE Bund):\r   \u0026ldquo;The requirements of the invoice recipient must be taken into account by the invoice sender, for example, that security-relevant authorities may only be able to receive attachments in PDF/A format. Whether and which restrictions apply to an invoice recipient must be requested from the respective invoice recipient.\u0026rdquo;\n The PDF/A module can also be purchased from BELWARE.\r  The Connector NAVs XRechnung module allows you to easily include supported document types in the resulting XRechnung. You can either attach these attachments to an invoice, or add them in the Send/Create dialog. Depending on the chosen method, setups in the User Reports are necessary.\nMethod 1 - Deposit attachments in invoices. Navigate to: Connector 365 -\u0026gt; User Reports.\nSelect the report for your sales invoices (Here: Standard Sales - Invoice, 1306) with the associated language code and user ID, if any, and select edit.\nIn the Controls tab, check Document links as attachments.\nThis checkmark must be set in order for the Connector to consider attached documents during XRechnung generation.\nNow navigate to the Sales Invoice Selection page from the Connector 365 Templates, select an invoice for which you want to store an attachment, and click Edit. The invoice will open. Now click Links. This button can be found in the top menu under the Start tab.\nAnother window will open:\nClick here on the gear icon:\nNow you will find two more fields, Link Address and Description. Click the box with the three dots, which can be found to the right of the link address field.\nExplorer should open, from which you can select and open any file. After you have done this, press Save.\nThe window will display the uploaded file. Now you can close the window and return to the Sales Invoice Selection overview.\nTo do this, check as usual that you have made the settings in the communication matrix for the customer in question.\nCommunication matrix entries for the example customer Gilde Jupiter Insurance.\nFor the PDF job mode and the report in question (here 1306 for Geb. Sales Invoices), enter the following:\nPlace a check mark in the XRechnung field and enter a routing ID. In addition, select the PEPPOL Usage (For this example Sales Invoice) and enter PEPPOL BIS3 for PEPPOL Version. You can select the latter two entries from the associated drop-down menu. If intended, you can select under XRechnung PDF as attachment whether the invoice PDF file should also be embedded.\nNext, navigate back to the Sales Invoice Selection page from the Connector 365 Templates and select an invoice that you want to convert to an XRechnung.\nThen select the invoice you are working on and press the PDF button.\nIf you have enabled Display dialog option for sales invoices, the dialog box will open (method 2).\nUnder the Attachments tab you should now see your uploaded file. Optionally, you can add more attachments (method 2). Now press OK, to convert the invoice including attachments into an XRechnung.\nMethod 2 - Add attachments via dialog. First, navigate to the user setup of the Connector NAV 365.\nUnder the Controls tab, check Dialog or Dialog PDF. (If Dialog is selected, a dialog will ALWAYS appear, for example, also when printing or sending an e-mail.)\nNow navigate to the Sales Invoice Selection page from the Connector 365 Templates, and select an invoice\nTo do this, check as usual that you have made the settings in the communication matrix for the customer concerned.\nCommunication entries for the example customer Gilde Jupiter Insurance.\nFor the PDF job mode and the report in question (here 1306 for Geb. Sales Invoices), enter the following:\nPlace a check mark in the XRechnung field and enter a routing ID. In addition, select the PEPPOL Usage (For this example Sales Invoice) and enter PEPPOL BIS3 for PEPPOL Version. You can select the latter two entries from the associated drop-down menu.\nNext, navigate back to the Sales Invoice Selection page from the Connector 365 Templates and select an invoice that you want to convert to an XRechnung.\nClick on the PDF button.\nAfter clicking the PDF button, the following dialog box opens:\nNow press the Add Files button in the Attachments tab. This will open another window where you can select a file to add as an attachment.\nSelect a file you want to attach and press Open.\nResult The selected file is now displayed as an attachment in the dialog box. Now click OK to generate an XRechnung. The generated XML file should now contain an entry for attachments.\nThis entry is followed by the attached file, encoded in Base64 format. The encoded strings are usually very long, as can be seen in the following test report:\nExcerpt of the test report on the XML file with attachment:\nThe public receivers are able to decode these encoded strings and thus recover the original attachment files.\n","description":"","id":247,"section":"connectornav","tags":null,"title":"Accompanying documents","uri":"https://docs.belware.de/en-us/connectornav/data-exchange/xrechnung/added_documents/"},{"content":"Deviating dispatch - using the destination address matrix The previous examples all worked without the matrix because direct related contacts were always accessed.\nNow, however, there is a deviating company logic. The service recipient is not the same as the invoice recipient, but a different company. Also the customers/suppliers play a role in the destination address. Despite person contact, there is a desire to send documents but basically to deviating/global addresses. Such requirements are not provided for in the Dynamics NAV / 365 BC standard.\nAt this point, the destination address matrix is used in the first step and the communication matrix in the second step. Thus, a control of recipient addresses is possible by simple configuration.\nWith the following examples we explain the use of the matrix:\nExample 1 - Offer directly to the invoice recipient If there is a different invoice recipient and you want the quote to go to the invoice recipient\u0026rsquo;s contact instead of the service recipient\u0026rsquo;s contact, you need to set up the destination address matrix for this. You can find it in the user reports, in this case for quotations.\nUser report quotations with expanded destination addresses.\nNow some kind of redirection has to be set up there.\nFirst, the intended job mode is selected. In this case \u0026ldquo;eMail.\u0026rdquo; Furthermore you need the tableID. In this example the 36, as well as the \u0026ldquo;Target from field no.\u0026rdquo;. For our example we need the 5053 - \u0026ldquo;Rech. an Kontaktnr.\u0026rdquo;. The last field determines what the destination address should be filled with, in this case the 102 - \u0026ldquo;E-Mail\u0026rdquo;.\nFilled destination addresses with intended settings.\nAgain back to our quote which should go to the invoice recipient. In our case the service recipient is Möbel-Meller KG and the invoice recipient is Candoxy Canada Inc.\nQuotation 1002 for Möbel-Meller - \u0026ldquo;Delivery and Invoice\u0026rdquo; unfolded.\nIf email dispatch is now triggered, rob.young@candoxy.ca will be selected as the destination address, since Mr. Young was specified as the contact at Candoxy Canada Inc. If no contact is selected, the email will still be sent to the contact of the service recipient. In the area of \u0026ldquo;Invoice to\u0026rdquo; only either the debtor or the contact can be selected as recipient. There is no priority control.\nDestination address is rob.young@candoxy.ca.\nThe settings selected in the user report are always valid for ALL offers, depending on the settings of the user report. It is not possible to filter by contact or debtor. This is only possible in conjunction with the communication matrix.\r Example 2 - Document dispatch to deviating addresses \u0026amp; collective addresses - use of the communication matrix Now we have an offer that is to be sent to an overlapping collective address (offers@moebel-meller.de). Here we need the communication matrix additionally. First, however, the user report for the offer must be adapted again. There only \u0026ldquo;Destination from field no.\u0026rdquo; must be set to \u0026ldquo;Sell-to Customer no.\u0026rdquo;. The rest can remain as set before. Now select the intended offer in the offer overview and click on the \u0026ldquo;Communication matrix\u0026rdquo; field.\nQuotation view - communication matrix highlighted.\nThe call to the communication matrix is located at all points in our templates and can be opened at any other intended pages. Our recommendation is to put the matrix at Contacts, Accounts Receivable and Accounts Payable. If you open the communication matrix at these places, it is already pre-filtered to the intended contact/DEB/KRE. Here in this example the Möbel-Meller KG.\nIn our example, all offers are to be sent to a central collective address \u0026ldquo;Angebote@moebel-meller.de\u0026rdquo;. For this purpose the following settings are made in the communication matrix\nIf the destination address matrix is set up correctly then the destination address of the respective contact is automatically drawn, thus saving a step in the setup. However, the destination address field can also be customized manually, either directly or through the Assist button.\r  Make this setting in the communication matrix.\nThe communication matrix allows us to additionally override the destination address matrix if additional or different rules come into play in the dispatch. Especially also for an automated batch dispatch or for post \u0026amp; send or post \u0026amp; process to control single or batch dispatch. In the overview you can also see the destination address matrix again. This is also decisive for the communication matrix.\nThere are further options in the matrix, which we will not go into in detail in this documentation. A detailed explanation of the standard fields and the extra functions can be found in the section \u0026ldquo;Options \u0026amp; advanced options of the communication matrix\u0026rdquo;.\nCommunication matrix for Furniture-Meller with the intended settings.\nAfter setting up the communication matrix, you can trigger the sending of the offer. The email will now be sent to the destination address we just set angebote@moebel-meller.de.\nDestination address is angebote@moebel-meller.de\n","description":"","id":248,"section":"connectornav","tags":null,"title":"Different shipping","uri":"https://docs.belware.de/en-us/connectornav/matrix/detour/"},{"content":"New in the documentations: As always, we have adapted our documentation according to the new features.

Using the validation report and with the help of the PEPPOL BIS Billing 3.0 Code Lists, most errors can be quickly eliminated.\nWe are also happy to assist you with the process of cleaning up your XRechnung.\nIn the following we list further points, which should be checked before using the XRechnung module, as these are common sources of errors.\nCheck VAT scheme You should check the VAT scheme codes for the respective countries.\nThese can be customized under \u0026ldquo;Countries/Regions\u0026rdquo; in Dynamics NAV. The quickest way to find this page is to use the search function. Make sure that the correct, numerical values for the respective regions are stored in the column \u0026ldquo;VAT scheme\u0026rdquo;. For Germany the value 9930 has to be entered. All other VAT scheme codes can be found in the official Code List: Electronic Address Scheme (EAS).\nCheck standard codes for units It is worth checking once to see if your units are entered correctly.\nThe fastest way to reach the page with your units is to enter \u0026lsquo;Units\u0026rsquo; in the search bar. To ensure PEPPOL/XRechnung compliance, each unit entered should have the associated international standard code stored. The unit codes can be obtained from the following lists:\n  UN/ECE Recommendation 20\n  UN/ECE Recommendation 21\n  Example: For the unit liter the international standard code LTR applies.\nCheck the tax category Also recommended is to take a look at the VAT posting matrix setup. You can find this most quickly using the search bar. Each VAT entry used requires a valid entry in the Tax Category field. The code list UNCL5305 determines which entries are allowed. Probably the most relevant tax category codes are \u0026lsquo;S\u0026rsquo; (Standard rate) and \u0026lsquo;E\u0026rsquo; (Exempt from tax).\nNegative invoice lines The XRechnung standard specifies that the net amount of an item must not be negative.\nSo problems can occur if items that are to be charged for refunds, for example, have been stored with a negative price. If an XRechnung contains an invoice line with a negative item amount, it will be considered not XRechnung compliant. To submit a negative invoice line, you should set the quantity to a negative amount instead, since it is allowed to be negative:\nExcerpt from the Coordination Office for IT Standards (KoSIT).\n","description":"","id":281,"section":"connectornav","tags":null,"title":"Troubleshooting information","uri":"https://docs.belware.de/en-us/connectornav/data-exchange/xrechnung/more_error_analysis/"},{"content":"Enhancements of standard features \u0026amp; new features:  The CTI client now opens automatically when Dynamics NAV is started.
