        <description>Optimizations: Outlook N-recipient addresses
When storing additional destination addresses, which were neither created as CC nor BCC, the address was previously taken as CC instead of the desired equivalent in the &amp;ldquo;To&amp;rdquo; field. This is now corrected.
Consideration of matrix printers
During batch processing, the additional printers from the communication matrix were not taken into account in the Print job mode. Now it is possible to use these printers as well.</description>
