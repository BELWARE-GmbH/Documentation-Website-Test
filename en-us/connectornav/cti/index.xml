Depending on what kind of phone system you have (Multi/Single Line) there is a different procedure for the setup.

        <description>Caller identification The module can also automatically detect who is calling you on incoming calls. To do this, you simply need to open the &amp;ldquo;CTI Client&amp;rdquo; button in your role center and keep it open in the background.
If there is now an incoming call while you have Dynamics NAV or the client open, the module matches the number of the incoming call with the numbers in your contact list and opens the card of the matching contact.</description>
