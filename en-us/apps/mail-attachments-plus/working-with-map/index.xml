        <description>Working with Mail Attachment Plus Once you have added all your desired attachments via the &amp;ldquo;Attachments &amp;ldquo; menu, you can start sending. If you have not done so yet, you can find the setup of the Document Default Attachments in the &amp;ldquo;Getting Started&amp;rdquo; section.
For the example, we have set up the attachments for a receipt as follows:
