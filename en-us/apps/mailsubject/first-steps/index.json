However, this automatically generated subject contains only your company name, the type of document and the number. This is often not enough, and you then have to manually add something to the generated subject or change it altogether because your company has certain requirements for your subject lines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the Connector 365 Mail Subject Plus app it is possible to define your own default subject lines, either per report or per customer/vendor. In doing so, you can freely define the new default subject. It is also possible to define your own placeholders for each report, allowing you to create dynamic text for your subject line. Simply enter the desired placeholder and link it to a field from the report.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSetting up the subject line is quick and easy via the document layout for customers/suppliers or via the report selection.\u003c/p\u003e\n"
