You only have to set this up accordingly in the document layouts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the batch dispatch is triggered while several job modes are set up for a document, they will be triggered one after the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eExample 1\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne scenario where this functionality may be desired would be in the transition phase from postal delivery to purely digital delivery via email, this looks like the following in the document layouts:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cp class=\"md__image\"\u003e\r\n  \u003cimg src=\"/Documentation-Website-Test/images/apps/easyscenario1en.PNG\" alt=\"\"  /\u003e\r\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis way, when the batch mailing is triggered, the corresponding debtors would receive an email and also a letter at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eExample 2\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother possible scenario would be to send it by email and print it for archiving. This would look like the following:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cp class=\"md__image\"\u003e\r\n  \u003cimg src=\"/Documentation-Website-Test/images/apps/easyscenario2en.PNG\" alt=\"\"  /\u003e\r\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBasically there are no limitations in the area of combinability of the different job modes. It depends only on the respective working method, in how far the different combinations make sense.\u003c/p\u003e\n"
