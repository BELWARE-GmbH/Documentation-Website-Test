The registration page can be found here (only available in German) but also directly in the Connector 365 E-POST App.\nWe will be happy to assist you in registering the E-POSTBUSINESS API with the Deutsche Post. To do so, simply contact support@belware.de.\r  In the registration form you will be asked for various contact information. Fill in the form, but first make sure that you are registering as a business customer.\nIt is also important to note that the personal data does not refer to the business owner, but to the admin who will take care of the E-POSTBUSINESS API.\nYou will come across the EKP number field in the form, this is an optional field. If you are already a Deutsche Post customer, you can enter your EKP (customer number) here, this will speed up the registration process.\r  After you have filled in all the important data, you can press the registration button at the bottom of the page.\nAn important step follows, on the next page, a mobile phone number is requested. Here it is important that you choose a number that will be accessible in the further course of the setup, because this number will receive the PIN for the generation of the secret in the later course.\nFinally, you will need to specify a payment method (which can also be changed later) and tell Deutsche Post which data will be used in your letters and by which people data will be used in your letters so that an commissioned processing of data agreement can be created.\nWhen these steps are done you can confirm the button \u0026ldquo;Order with costs\u0026rdquo; to complete the registration.\nThe registration of the E-POSTBUSINESS API is free of charge. Only postage costs are due, as usual. Current E-POSTBUSINESS API postage costs (only available in German). Deutsche Post will settle the postage costs directly with you.\r  After completing the registration, you will receive an e-mail at the address you provided previously, which confirms the registration. Within the next 3 working days you will receive your order data (and your EKP) from Deutsche Post, which concludes the registration and allows you to proceed with the setup.\n*The Connector 365 E-POST App is powered by the E-POSTBUSINESS API, a service of the Deutsche Post\n","description":"","id":77,"section":"Apps","tags":null,"title":"Registration","uri":"https://belware-gmbh.github.io/Documentation-Website-Test/en-us/apps/e-post/first-steps/registration/"},{"content":"Setup Setting up addresses per report in the report selection To set up addresses in the report selection you first need to open the search function and search for \u0026ldquo;report selection\u0026rdquo;.

Inv. XRechnung 2.0 must be specified in an EventSubscriber.\nBeispiel:\nFor sales credit notes or service credit notes, the following XML port must be entered: BEL365 S. Cr. M. XRechnung 2.0.\nExample:\nThe XRechnung events offer the possibility to \u0026ldquo;fill\u0026rdquo; business terms after they are set by default and before they are further processed, i.e. inserted into the resulting XML file. The business terms are passed as text variables. Prepended to these variables is the keyword VAR, which indicates that the variables are references to the original variables.\nAfter you have defined a function as a subscriber, you can fill the passed variables as you like and according to your own logic.\nExample*\nThe function SubAfterGetLineInvoicePeriod is here a subscriber for the event OnAfterGetLineInvoicePeriodInfo.\nRegardless of the default logic of filling the variables, InvLineInvoicePeriodEndDate after generating the XRechnung now contains the value \u0026ldquo;2021-04-15\u0026rdquo; and thus appears in the resulting XML file. The same procedure applies to all other events.\nThe following is a list of the available events and the variables to be changed with them.\nAt the beginning of the XML port, it is checked whether the document is a sales document or a service document. Then the associated record variables are transferred to the \u0026ldquo;Sales Header\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Sales Line\u0026rdquo; variables, which are used from there on throughout the XML port.
