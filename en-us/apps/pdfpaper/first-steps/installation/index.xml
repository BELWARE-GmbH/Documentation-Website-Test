        <description>Installation iPaper In order to use the PdfPaper app, you must first install the folder monitoring version of the iPaper software. Due to various technical circumstances, we currently only support iPaper version 3.0.61 - you can download this version here.
After downloading you can install the software like any other software using the included wizard. For this an internet connection is necessary, because during the setup the interface Ghostscript is also installed.</description>
