        <description>First steps Fast hybrid sending with the Connector 365 E-POST App The need to receive invoices by mail is still ubiquitous. What does this mean for my ERP Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central, which can be used from anywhere? Document processing in the traditional sense - printing, inserting, franking and posting at the post office - can delay the process - especially if the document creator is not on-site. Depending on the volume of documents to be sent, this process can become even more time-consuming - time that could be used more productively.</description>
