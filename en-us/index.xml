        <description>First steps Fast hybrid sending with the Connector 365 E-POST App The need to receive invoices by mail is still ubiquitous. What does this mean for my ERP Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central, which can be used from anywhere? Document processing in the traditional sense - printing, inserting, franking and posting at the post office - can delay the process - especially if the document creator is not on-site. Depending on the volume of documents to be sent, this process can become even more time-consuming - time that could be used more productively.</description>

Another way to add attachments is to add them as defaults for customers, for example, if there are conditions that only apply to a specific customer. Open the customer you want to add defaults to and expand the options in the menu via &amp;ldquo;More options&amp;rdquo;, click &amp;ldquo;Navigate&amp;rdquo; and select &amp;ldquo;Document layouts&amp;rdquo;.

For the example, we have set up the attachments for a receipt as follows:
An image and a PDF have been set as standard.
If you are using a Business Central version in which the Mail Experience is not yet available, the procedure is a little different.</description>
