        <description>First steps Fast hybrid sending with the Connector 365 E-POST App The need to receive invoices by mail is still ubiquitous. What does this mean for my ERP Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central, which can be used from anywhere? Document processing in the traditional sense - printing, inserting, franking and posting at the post office - can delay the process - especially if the document creator is not on-site. Depending on the volume of documents to be sent, this process can become even more time-consuming - time that could be used more productively.</description>

        <description>First steps Introduction When you send emails via Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central, the system automatically generates a subject line for you. However, this automatically generated subject contains only your company name, the type of document and the number. This is often not enough, and you then have to manually add something to the generated subject or change it altogether because your company has certain requirements for your subject lines.</description>

        <description>Working with Easy Batch Archive After a batch processing has been performed, the processed documents are listed in the Connector 365 activities. You can find this overview in two places:
Directly on the document.
You can find it directly in the factbox to the right of your documents.

        <description>Tabular body text A good way to design a body text clearly is to insert a table into the file and then take this as a basis for further editing. This also allows further design options such as highlighting different cells or variable placement of text/images.
If wished, you must hide the border lines when you are done with your table. Place holder in body texts For an email body text template, you can use place holders for components that are individual to each employee, for example, name or email address.</description>

        <description>Creating a pure PEPPOL XML via the PDF job mode. First you have to go to the pdfPaper setup to fill in the storage path for the created PEPPOL-XMLs. This can be found under &amp;ldquo;Peppol storage folder&amp;rdquo;. It is important here that there is an authorization to store files in the path. Therefore we recommend to create an additional folder in the T611 structure of the Connector NAV, for example &amp;ldquo;com_peppol&amp;rdquo;.</description>

        <description>&amp;ldquo;Where do I find spreadsheetIDs?&amp;rdquo; In order to start with the matrix, we must first find out which spreadsheed the report is. This is done by clicking on the blue field with the arrows in the upper left corner of Dynamics NAV / 365 Business Central in an open quote or overview, then on &amp;ldquo;Help&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;About this page&amp;rdquo;.
Here you can find &amp;ldquo;About this page&amp;rdquo;.

        <description>Working with CTI for STARFACE The call list Incoming and outgoing calls are recorded in two places. Either directly in the contacts or on a global level in the joblist.
CTI Entries In your contacts you can find the &amp;ldquo;CTI Entries&amp;rdquo;, these are located at the end of the contact card. There you can find the details of all phone calls made to this contact, such as whether it was incoming or outgoing, who made the call, when the call was answered and how long it lasted.</description>

        <description>Caller identification The module can also automatically detect who is calling you on incoming calls. To do this, you simply need to open the &amp;ldquo;CTI Client&amp;rdquo; button in your role center and keep it open in the background.
If there is now an incoming call while you have Dynamics NAV or the client open, the module matches the number of the incoming call with the numbers in your contact list and opens the card of the matching contact.</description>

To get the status for sent E-Post API letters, it is recommended to set up a task queue for it as well. This requires a similar procedure as for the E-Post Summary queue. To do this, open the Task Queue Item page and create a new queue item.</description>

        <description>Working with XRechnung Events We offer you the possibility to link into our programming logic with events, here we describe how this works.
To subscribe an event for sales invoices or service invoices, the XML port BEL365 S. Inv. XRechnung 2.0 must be specified in an EventSubscriber.
Beispiel:
For sales credit notes or service credit notes, the following XML port must be entered: BEL365 S. Cr. M. XRechnung 2.0.

        <description>Example progress password assignment By assigning passwords, you can protect sentitive content when it is sent. Because an unprotected PDF file is comparable to a postcard - anyone who has access can read it. You have various options for assigning passwords.
Function âShow passwordâ Of course, it is important that passwords remain protected - however, it can happen that passwords are forgotten or misplaced. For this case there is a function &amp;ldquo;Show password&amp;rdquo; - this function, which can be assigned on a user basis, allows to view the password of PDF files.</description>

        <description>Job files and feedback massages This chapter is only relevant for licensing an interface with external communication software (OfficeMaster, Twinfax, Tobit, Faxmaker, C3000).
After the dialog has been confirmed with OK, the Connector NAV stores a text file in the path com_job and the job identifier from Connector NAV Setup. This is picked up and processed by the communication software. Afterwards the software returns a feedback file. This is located under com_ack or com_err.</description>

        <description>So where do the recipients&#39; e-mail addresses come from? (Using without target and communication matrix) The Connector NAV / 365 BC works analogously to the standard dispatch. We will use various examples to explain how the mail dispatch process works. For the following 3 examples we limit ourselves to the report Quotations. The service recipient is the same as the invoice recipient. The process is the same for each report.</description>

        <description>Routing ID As mentioned earlier, the routing ID is used to uniquely identify invoice recipients to enable addressing and, if necessary, routing of electronic invoices to the correct administrative units. Basically, a routing ID consists of the following components:
  Coarse addressing
  Fine addressing (optional)
  Check digit
  Further information on the structure of a routing ID can be found here.
The Connector is able to check the syntax of a route ID for correctness.</description>

        <description>Optimizations: Outlook N-recipient addresses
When storing additional destination addresses, which were neither created as CC nor BCC, the address was previously taken as CC instead of the desired equivalent in the &amp;ldquo;To&amp;rdquo; field. This is now corrected.
Consideration of matrix printers
During batch processing, the additional printers from the communication matrix were not taken into account in the Print job mode. Now it is possible to use these printers as well.</description>

  Text/CSV (.csv)
  Application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheethtml.sheet (.xslx)
  Excel tables
  Application/vnd.oasis.opendocument.spreadsheet (.ods)
  OpenDocument tables

        <description>Deviating dispatch - using the destination address matrix The previous examples all worked without the matrix because direct related contacts were always accessed.
Now, however, there is a deviating company logic. The service recipient is not the same as the invoice recipient, but a different company. Also the customers/suppliers play a role in the destination address. Despite person contact, there is a desire to send documents but basically to deviating/global addresses.</description>

        <description>Send XRechnung directly by e-mail (Connector e-mail module) If you have also installed the Connector365 module Email, you can send an XRechnung directly by e-mail through the Connector after it has been generated. For this you have to make an adjustment in the communication matrix.
Simply change the value of the Job Mode field from PDF to Email. In addition, you can optionally enter a default destination address. Now the marked invoice can be converted to XRechnung format via the Email button, or via the Batch button, if the batch mode entry has been marked, and sent on directly via e-mail.</description>

        <description>Analyze validation results in case of error During the validation of the XRechnung file, it can of course also happen that an XRechnung is classified as non-compliant. This happens when important information is missing from the invoice. For example, validation will fail even if the customer&amp;rsquo;s city is not specified.
To simulate a case where validation fails, we modify the above procedure to &amp;ldquo;forget&amp;rdquo; to specify a routing ID. To do this, we again open the Communication Matrix for our example calculation 103003, and remove the value for the route ID.</description>

        <description>Book and process functions Similar to the standard functions post &amp;amp; send and post &amp;amp; print, the post &amp;amp; process function allows you to process a document after posting. In contrast to the standard, the function allows you to process the document through all Connector NAV interfaces. In addition, you have the possibility to send a document multiple times via different channels, e.g. letter &amp;amp; e-mail.
How exactly the respective document should be processed, you can set up in our communication matrix.</description>

        <description>Further information on troubleshooting In this documentation, a possible case of an incorrect validation was shown as an example. In addition to the problem shown there with the routing ID, there are several other sources of errors. Therefore, it is enormously advantageous to use a validation service, as otherwise errors may only be noticed in one of the invoice portals or by the invoice recipient. Using the validation report and with the help of the PEPPOL BIS Billing 3.</description>
