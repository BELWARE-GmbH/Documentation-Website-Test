You can set this up in the user setup. Go to the search and look for &amp;ldquo;User Setup&amp;rdquo;, if the user does not already exist, add it to the setup. Then put another check mark in the &amp;ldquo;Attachment Plus&amp;rdquo; field.

        <description>First steps Fast hybrid sending with the Connector 365 E-POST App The need to receive invoices by mail is still ubiquitous. What does this mean for my cloud ERP Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central, which can be used from anywhere? Invoice processing in the traditional sense - printing, inserting, franking and posting at the post office - can delay the process - especially if the invoice creator is not on-site. Depending on the volume of invoices to be sent, this process can become even more time-consuming - time that could be used more productively.</description>

        <description>Setup Adding default attachments per report Default attachments are a great way to save time when adding files to your emails. If you use the same attachment in every email, just add it as a default and it will be automatically attached to every email.
Start by opening the report selection of the report you want, in this example we will use Sales and Invoices. If you are not sure where to find the report selector, you can always use the Dynamics 365 Business Central search feature.</description>

        <description>Setup Standard attachments per customer and report. Another way to add attachments is to add them as defaults for customers, for example, if there are conditions that only apply to a specific customer. Open the customer you want to add defaults to and expand the options in the menu via &amp;ldquo;More options&amp;rdquo;, click &amp;ldquo;Navigate&amp;rdquo; and select &amp;ldquo;Document layouts&amp;rdquo;.
Select the report for which you want to add default attachments, we will use invoices again in this example.</description>

For the example, we have set up the attachments for a receipt as follows:
An image and a PDF have been set as standard.
